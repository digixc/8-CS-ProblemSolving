- In the last lesson we looked at how to use structured English to describe specific steps to solve a problem.
- Sometimes, the problem is complex or seemingly complex. A common approach to solve a complex problem is to break down the problem into smaller, easier to solve problems.  After we solved each of those smaller problems, the complex problem is solved.
- The above approach to problem solving is called *divid-and-conquer*. 
- In computer science, to breaking down a problem into smaller, easier to solve problems is called *decomposition*.
- Let's try *decomposition* on the following not so complex problem:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
 Write a program such that when a user inputs a number, the program
will output it is an even or an odd number.
#+END_SRC

- To break down the above problem, we are going to use flowchart to help us. 
- Flowcharts are very useful in visualising how algorithms work.

* Algorithms with Flowchart

:END:
- A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows.
- Each shape represent some steps in the algorithm:
[[./img/flowChartShapes.png]]
- The following is a simple example of using flowchart to describe the steps to a simple problem of determing if an user's input numbers are odd or not. 
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="./img/even-or-odd.png" width=400 height=400>
#+END_EXPORT
- The above problem has been decomposed into three parts:
  1. a user input a number
  2. determine if the number is even or odd
  3. output the appropriate message depending on the above step
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Write a computer game that allows a user to guess the number that is
 picked by a computer. If the user guessed the number, the user is 
declared a winner. If the user guessed incorrectly, the computer will
 tell the user if the guess is too high or two low. 
#+END_SRC
- Try your *decomposition* skill with the above problem.
- The first few steps have been started for you:
  1. computer pick a number
  2. a user input a number

- Finish decomposing the problem by finishing all steps required to reach a solution.
- Create a flowchart using appropriate symbols for your steps.

- Launch the application flowol, click on File->New and you should see something like the following:
[[./img/flowol-1.PNG]]
- Select the =lighthouse mimic= by clicking on it
- The scenario or mimic has one input:the Sun and three outputs: Lamp, Lights and Foghorn
[[./img/flowol-lighthouse-1.PNG]]
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- flowol is simple to use once you know it
- See if you can work out how to create a flowchart as shown below:
[[./img/flowol-lighthouse-2.PNG]]
- If you stuck, ask your teacher to show you
** Badge It - Gold
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: gold
:END:
*** Learning Strand: Algorithms
- The above flowchart will make the three outputs flash on and off every two seconds
- Your task is to create a flowhcart so that:
  - when the Sun is down(off), all the three outputs will flash
  - when the Sun is up (on), if the Lights are not on, the Foghorn should be on, and if the Lights are on, the Foghorn should be off.
- Test your flowchart by clicking on the Sun to turn it on and off.
- Screenshot your working flowchart and upload to BTL

** Badge It - Platinum

:END:
*** Learning Strand: Algorithms

- Now you are familar with how the software =flowol= works. 
- The above mimic has all three outputs flash on and off. 
- follow the steps shown in the image below to create a flash function:
[[./img/flowol-define-function.png]]
- Once you have created a function, the side menu will now have *Sub* block for you to use the functions you have created.
[[./img/flowol-function.png]]
- Modify your flowchart from the Gold badge task to use this function. 
- Test your flowchart as you have done with your Gold badge and upload the screenshot of your working flowchart to BTL.
