- In the last lesson we looked at a program called Flowol that lets us use flowcharts to control and interact with situations called "mimics".
- Today we are going to use Flowol to create a *sequence* of instructions to solve certain problems.
- Computers follow instructions or sequences programmed into them. A flowchart can be used to help design a sequence. Actions can be ordered, reordered or removed if no longer necessary.

*Task 1 - Traffic Lights*

- Look at this video to see the sequence of lights on a traffic light.

- *Copy* this table by selecting it by clicking and dragging you mouse from the top left ot the bottom right.
- *Paste* it into a PowerPoint slide and complete the rest of the instructions, use the video above for help.

| DELAY for __ seconds            |
| Red light ON and amber light ON |

- Remember that a flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows.
- Each shape represent some steps in the algorithm:
[[./img/flowChartShapes.png]]
- The following is a simple example of using flowchart to describe the steps to a simple problem of determing if an user's input numbers are odd or not.

** Try It
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Try your *sequencing* skills by turning your table of steps from the traffic lights into a flowchart in *PowerPoint*.
- Use the image below to start you off, then complete your flowchart.

** Badge It - Silver

*** Learning Strand: Algorithms
- Finish your sequence for the problem by finishing all steps required to reach a solution.
- Create a flowchart in *Powerpoint* using appropriate symbols for your steps.
- Upload your *flowchart* to www.bournetolearn.com, Week 5 Silver for Problem Solving.
* Using Flowol for Flowcharts

- Launch the application Flowol 4, click on File->New and you should see something like the following:
[[./img/flowol-1.PNG]]
- Select the =Bridge Lights mimic= by clicking on it
- Follow this video to make a flowchart that controls one set of lights.

- Your flowchart should look like this after following the video:

*** Learning Strand: Algorithms
- You're halfway to the Gold badge, but at the moment only one set of lights work.
- See if you can work out how to make the second set of lights work with the first by showing a red light when the first shows green, amber at the same time and green when the first shows red.
- Your finished Gold badge work should make your lights look like this video, if they don't then try again.

- *HINT*: Click on one of your Output blocks, you can change both sets of lights using one block.
- If you get stuck, remember to ask your teacher for help.
** Badge It - Platinum

*** Learning Strand: Algorithms

- Now you are familar with how =Flowol= works. 
- For your Platinum badge you need to download the PDF file at the link below:
[[./doc/Ferris.pdf][Right click here then Save Link As]] to save the file to your Computer Science folder.
- Open the file in a program called Adobe Acrobat, right click the file in your Problem solving folder and select "Open With" then "Adobe Acrobat".
- Follow the instructions and complete the 3 flowcharts it instructs you to complete.
- Then screenshot your flowcharts and upload to the *Platinum badge for Week 5*.
