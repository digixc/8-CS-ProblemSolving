- You have been solving problems all your life, from obvious problems such as puzzle games, like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi][Tower of Hanoi]], to going through your every day life. As you mature, you are getting better at it.

- Lets work through some problems and see how you solve them.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Problem 1: You have accidentally broken your mum's favourite mug.
Solutions:
         A. You clean up all the mess and destroy the evidence
         B. You quickly buy a replacement before your mum notices it
         C. You apologise and hope for forgiveness
         D. You glue the mug back and apologise
         E. You do other chores to make up for the damage

What is your solution? Why?
#+END_SRC
- Can you describe the steps and reasons you followed to reach your solution for the above problem to the person next to you?

#+BEGIN_SRC 
Problem 2: You are playing a game in the TV room and your little 
           brother or sister is sitting next to you. As soon as you put
           down the controller, you know you will not get it back from 
           him or her for a long time. But your mum is calling you 
           urgently and she does not like seeing anyone taking the
           controller away from the TV room.
 
 What will you do? 
#+END_SRC

- Can you describe the steps you followed to solve the above problem to the person next to you?


#+BEGIN_SRC 
Problem 3: You have been asked by your teacher to rank the quiz score 
           in your form for each of the 8 teams from the highest to the lowest.
           
How do you do it? 
          
#+END_SRC
- Try to describe the steps you used to the person next to you. 
- Is your solution more efficient?

- As a human, you find that sorting the scores from 8 teams is quite easy.
- But what about sorting the whole year's? the whole school's? You can, but it will take you a much longer time.
- You may be already thinking about computers and using spreadsheet to help you sort a much longer list of scores.
- But humans must create spreadsheet software first. What's more the spreadsheet software humans created must be able to sort numbers.
- When we deal with large amount of data and more complex problems, computers can *help* us to solve those problems more quickly than humans can, *BUT* humans must describe the steps to solve the problems to the computers first.
- *Computational thinking* is the thought processes of understanding a problem and presenting its solution(s) in such a way that a computer can effectively carry out.
