- In the last lesson we looked at a program called Flowol that lets us use flowcharts to control and interact with situations called "mimics".
- Today we are going to use Flowol to create a *sequence* of instructions to solve certain problems.
- Computers follow instructions or sequences programmed into them. A flowchart can be used to help design a sequence. Actions can be ordered, reordered or removed if no longer necessary.

*Task 1 - Traffic Lights*

- Look at this video to see the sequence of lights on a traffic light.

- *Copy* this table by selecting it by clicking and dragging you mouse from the top left ot the bottom right.
- *Paste* it into a PowerPoint slide and complete the rest of the instructions, use the video above for help.

- Remember that a flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows.
- Each shape represent some steps in the algorithm:
[[./img/flowChartShapes.png]]
- The following is a simple example of using flowchart to describe the steps to a simple problem of determing if an user's input numbers are odd or not.

- Try your *sequencing* skills by turning your table of steps from the traffic lights into a flowchart in PowerPoint.

*** Learning Strand: Algorithms
- Finish decomposing the problem by finishing all steps required to reach a solution.
- Create a flowchart using appropriate symbols for your steps.
- Upload both your *steps* and *flowchart* to www.bournetolearn.com

- Launch the application flowol, click on File->New and you should see something like the following:
[[./img/flowol-1.PNG]]
- Select the =lighthouse mimic= by clicking on it
- The scenario or mimic has one input:the Sun and three outputs: Lamp, Lights and Foghorn
[[./img/flowol-lighthouse-1.PNG]]
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- flowol is simple to use once you know it
- See if you can work out how to create a flowchart as shown below:
[[./img/flowol-lighthouse-2.PNG]]
- If you stuck, ask your teacher to show you
** Badge It - Gold
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: gold
:END:
*** Learning Strand: Algorithms
- The above flowchart will make the three outputs flash on and off every two seconds
- Your task is to create a flowhcart so that:
  - when the Sun is down(off), all the three outputs will flash
  - when the Sun is up (on), if the Lights are not on, the Foghorn should be on, and if the Lights are on, the Foghorn should be off.
- Test your flowchart by clicking on the Sun to turn it on and off.
- Screenshot your working flowchart and upload to BTL

** Badge It - Platinum
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: platinum
:END:
*** Learning Strand: Algorithms

- Now you are familar with how the software =flowol= works. 
- The above mimic has all three outputs flash on and off. 
- follow the steps shown in the image below to create a flash function:
[[./img/flowol-define-function.png]]
- Modify your flowchart from the Gold badge task to use this function. 
- Test your flowchart as you have done with your Gold badge and upload the screenshot of your working flowchart to BTL.
