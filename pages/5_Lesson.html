<li>In the last lesson, we looked at the principles of computational thinking: decomposition and abstraction
</li>
<li>Today we will be looking at pattern recognition and applying this alongside decomposition and abstraction to solve problems.

<li>Problem solving is an excellent life skill and can help you in any career choice that you make.

<h3 id="sec-2-2">Learn It – Pattern Recognition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With many problems, there is often a give-away in the details, some piece of information which repeats or changes in a specific way.
</li>
<li>For example, in Mathematics you often see number sequences where there is a clear pattern to the changes.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-2-3">Try It – Pattern Recognition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Look at the following 3 number sequences, can you identify the pattern in how they change? Make a note of each!
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
Pattern 1:
     1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256

Pattern 2:
     0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

Pattern 3:
     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
</pre>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How did you work out the patterns? 
</li>
<li>Was one of them more difficult than the others? 
</li>
<li>When looking for patterns, some of them we can decipher by using <b>decomposition</b> (looking at a small subset of numbers) to identify the rules used.
</li>
<li>Others, however, we need to use <b>abstraction</b> to focus on the numbers themselves to identify a common theme.

<li>Assassin is a popular game on college campuses. The game consists of several players trying to eliminate the others by means of squirting them with water pistols in order to be the last survivor. Once hit, the player is out of the game.

<li>At Bourne Grammar School, 5 teachers participated in a game that only lasted four days. Can you determine each teachers’ name, their team color, their assassin alias, how they were eliminated, and their extra-curricular activity?

Goodbye red player.
